# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers

# Non-numbers

# True, False

# Nothing

# Variables

# Combine strings and variables

# String manipulation

# put the number 2 on the screen
#puts 2

#put the number 5 on screen
#puts 5

#puts 2 + 5

#put our favorite food on screen
#puts "tacos"

#true and false values
#puts true
#puts false

#store the number 5 in memory
#x = 5

#store the number 2 in memory

#y = 2

#multiply the two numbers and show them on screen
#puts x * y

# store my favorite food in memory

favorite_food = "tacos"



# store the number of tacos
number_of_tacos = 5

#create my order

my_order = "#{number_of_tacos}... #{favorite_food}"

# write my order to the screen

puts my_order
